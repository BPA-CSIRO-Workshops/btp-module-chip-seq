# btp-module-chip-seq
Bioinformatics Training Platform (BTP) Module: ChIP-Seq

  * Topic
    * ChIP-Seq
  * Target Audience
    * Biologists
	* Non-bioinformaticians
	* Little to no programming expereience
  * Prerequisites
    * [btp-module-ngs-mapping](https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-module-ngs-mapping)
  * KLOs
    * Perform simple ChIP-Seq analysis, e.g. the detection of immuno-enriched areas using the chosen peak caller program MACS.
	* Visualize the peak regions through a genome browser, e.g. Ensembl, and identify the real peak regions.
	* Perform functional annotation and detect potential binding sites (motif),in the predicted binding regions using motif discovery tool, e.g. MEME.
  * Time Required
    * 
  * Compute Requirements
